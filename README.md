# Text Cipher Converter

This HTML page allows users to convert normal text to cipher text and vice versa using JavaScript.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Converts normal text to cipher text by shifting each character's Unicode value by one position.
- **Decryption**: Converts cipher text back to normal text.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the input text area.
3. Click the "Encrypt" button to convert the text to cipher text.
4. Click the "Decrypt" button to convert the cipher text back to normal text.
5. The result will be displayed in the output text area.

## Example

- Input: "Hello, World!"
- Encryption: "Ifmmp-!Xpsme\" (each character shifted by +1)
- Decryption: "Hello, World!" (each character shifted back by -1)

## Notes

- This is a basic encryption and decryption method for demonstration purposes.
- Do not use this for sensitive information as it provides minimal security.
